\item{gene_reference}{information extracted from gtf file}

\item{reads}{information from RNAseq samples}

\item{min_reads}{minium reads count required at single gene level for PAS calling and PAU calculation}

\item{cores}{number of threads used for the computation}

\item{direct_RNA}{whether or not the data is direct RNAseq}

\item{internal_priming}{whether or not PASs subject to internal priming filtering}

\item{pattern}{to look for internal priming sequencing surrouding PAS, either "pre", "post" or "both".}

}
\value{
a table showing the uasage of top PASs for each single gene with enough depth in the dataset of each sample
}
\description{
This function extract PolyA sites information of each gene and calculate the usage of each found PAS from the provided RNAseq data.
